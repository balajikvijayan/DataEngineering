1. What are the four communication patterns of distributed systems?
2. Which of those four puts the most strain on the network? 
3. Which of the following is *not* provided by the batch and serving layers:
	1. Debuggability
	2. Extensibility
	3. Ad hoc queries
	4. Generalization
	5. Fault-tolerance
	6. Low-latency updates
	7. Scalability
	8. Minimal maintenance
4. Which of the following is false about recomputation algorithms?
	1. Complexity of the algorithm is addressed during precomputation, resulting in simple batch views and low-latency, on-the-fly processing
	2. They are extremely tolerant of human errors (compared to incremental algorithms)
	3. They require less computational resources but may generate much larger batch views (than incremental algorithms)
	4. They are essential to supporting a robust data-processing system
