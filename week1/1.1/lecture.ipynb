    "## Data Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common form of data persistence is the flat file. You open up a text\n",
    "editor, enter some information, and save the file to disk. You've just persisted\n",
    "some data and can transfer that file wherever you wish. For most data, that's\n",
    "enough, but for many applications, there are additional constraints other than\n",
    "persistence and portability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Ease of sharing between programming languages\n",
    "  * Reliability guarantees \n",
    "  * Data integrity guarantees (e.g. no duplication)\n",
    "  * Ability to query data efficiently\n",
    "  * Ability to model relations in data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first constraint is easily met by data formats such as JSON, CSV, or XML.\n",
    "All mainstream programming languages have libraries to convert these formats to\n",
    "native data structures and back to the interchange format. For example, Python\n",
    "has the `json` module that converts between JSON strings and Python dicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these widely used data formats cannot meet the other constraints\n",
    "listed above (and this is by no means an exhaustive list of desirable\n",
    "constraints on data persistence).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases such as PosgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite were built for just\n",
    "those purposes. They provide the ability to model relations in data and query\n",
    "the data and their relations efficiently. They also provide a bevy of guarantees\n",
    "to maintain data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: The sorts of guarantees that these databases provide is beyond\n",
    "the scope of this document (and this class), but feel free to reference the\n",
    "resources at the bottom of this document if you're interested in learning more\n",
    "about the underlying theory of relational databases.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## The RDBMS Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases have a **schema** that defines the structure of the data.\n",
    "Each database is composed of a number of user-defined **tables**, each with\n",
    "**columns** and **rows**. Each column is of a certain **data type** such as\n",
    "integer, string, or date. Each row is an entry in the table with data for each\n",
    "column of that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a database table creation specifying a `users` table with various\n",
    "fields and their data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (\n",
    "    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\n",
    ",   name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ",   age INTEGER\n",
    ",   city VARCHAR(255)\n",
    ",   state VARCHAR(2));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The data types available to you vary from system to system. These above are from\n",
    "PostgreSQL. `VARCHAR` is a string data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **primary key** is a column in a table that uniquely identifies that entry. No\n",
    "two rows in the same table can share a value for a column specified as primary\n",
    "key. The primary key column is most often `id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of what this users table looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " id | name  | age |     city      | state\n",
    "----+-------+-----+---------------+-------\n",

    "## Modeling Relations in RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the power of relational databases are their ability to model relations\n",
    "in data. The way they do so is through the use of **foreign keys**.\n",
    "A foreign key is a column that references some other entry in the database.\n",
    "That foreign entry could be in the same table or in some other table. Foreign\n",
    "keys are how relations are modeled in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say there is another table that contains data for each visit\n",
    "to our website. Each time a user visits the site, a row is created and inserted\n",
    "into the `visits` table. We'd like to maintain some data that indicates which\n",
    "visit is associated with which user (so that we could later, for example, find\n",
    "the users who visited our site the most). Each visit then will have a `user_id`\n",
    "that can connect it to a user in the `users` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the definition of the `visits` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE VISITS (\n",
    "  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\n",
    ",  created_at TIMESTAMP\n",
    ",  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id) );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of what this users table looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " id |     created_at      | customer_id\n",
    "----+---------------------+-------------\n",
    "  1 | 2015-06-20 00:00:00 |           1\n",
    "  2 | 2015-07-30 00:00:00 |           1\n",
    "  3 | 2015-06-20 00:00:00 |           3\n",
    "  4 | 2015-04-09 00:00:00 |           1\n",
    "  5 | 2015-03-09 00:00:00 |           2\n",
    "... | \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we specify not only that the `visits` table has a column called `customer_id`,\n",
    "but that the column references the `id` column in the `customers` table. PostgreSQL\n",
    "will treat this as a constraint and ensure that new visits have a `customer_id`\n",
    "value that references an actual user in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-to-one\n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-to-one relationship, place the foreign key on either side of the\n",
    "relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Customers and Licenses**\n",
    "Licenses is a table that holds the _most recent_ driver's license number for a customer,\n",
    "because customers can only have 1 driver's license at time, it will be a one-to-one relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE LICENSES (\n",
    "  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\n",
    ", state VARCHAR(2)\n",
    ", number VARCHAR(20)\n",
    ", uploaded_at TIMESTAMP\n",
    ", customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id)\n",
    ", UNIQUE(state, number))\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT * FROM licenses;\n",
    " id | state |   number   |     uploaded_at     | customer_id\n",

    "  2 | CA    | DL19852984 | 2014-05-12 00:00:00 |           1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the license for a customer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM licenses\n",
    "WHERE customer_id=?\n",
    "LIMIT 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Notice** we also used a UNIQUE constraint as the last part of our CREATE TABLE statement.\n",
    "This is part of the power of SQL.  Because State and Driver's Licenses numbers should be unique,\n",
    "we can help limit data input errors by placing a UNIQUE constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-to-many and many-to-one\n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-to-many/many-to-one relationship (they are inverses of each other),\n",
    "place the foreign key on the many side of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Customer and Visits**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the visits for a customer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM visits\n",
    "WHERE customer_id=?\n",

    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE id=?\n",
    "LIMIT 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Many-to-many\n",
    "\n",
    "For a many-to-many relationship, create a table that contains two foreign keys,\n",
    "one to each side of the relationship. This intermediate table is often referred\n",
    "to as a **JOIN table**.\n",

    "**Example 1: Customers and Products**\n",

    "Here is our products table.  It lists all the products in the inventory.\n",

    "## Schema Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a database schema (the tables and columns the database will\n",
    "contain), we aim to minimize redundancy. This most importantly comes into play\n",
    "with relations between data. As you saw above, when you want to relate data to\n",
    "each other, use a simple foreign key - that's the smallest piece of information\n",
    "that you can keep about another entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, each post has an author, which is an entry in the `users` table.\n",
    "In a fully normalized schema, the post entry would have a `user_id` which would\n",
    "relate the post to a user. A denormalized way of doing this would be to have a\n",
    "column in the `posts` table called `author_name`, which would duplicate the\n",
    "`name` column in the `users` table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is largely about reducing redundancy. The cost is that some\n",
    "queries will take longer to run because you will have to look up additional\n",
    "information in other tables. The benefit is simplicity and a system that is\n",
    "easier to understand and use. Always start with a fully normalized schema and\n",
    "then when performance becomes an issue, you can consider selectively\n",
    "denormalizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about database normalization from [Wikipedia][wiki-normal].\n",
    "\n",
    "[wiki-normal]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Structed Query Language (SQL) is the language used to query relational\n",
    "databases. All RDBMS use SQL and the syntax and keywords are for the most part\n",
    "the same across systems, though each system does have some of its own\n",
    "peculiarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is used to interact with RDBMS. That is, it allows you to create tables,\n",
    "alter tables, insert records, update records, delete records, and query for\n",
    "records within and across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will focus primarily on querying.**\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL, unlike Python or many other general purpose programming languages, is a\n",
    "declarative language, meaning the query describes the set of results. Here's an\n",
    "example of a simple query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, age\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query returns the name and age for every user in the `users` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, age\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE state = 'CA'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query returns the name and age for every customer in the `customers` table who\n",
    "lives in CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL queries are composed of **clauses**. Each clause begins with a **keyword**.\n",
    "Every query begins with the `SELECT` clause followed by the `FROM` and\n",
    "`JOIN` clauses. You then have the ability to apply filtering, aggregation, and\n",
    "ordering clauses. \n",
    "\n",
    "While `SELECT` appears at the top of the query, it is actually very nearly the\n",
    "last part of the query that is executed. `SELECT` specifies the columns that\n",
    "should be returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The most important parts of any SQL query are the `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses.**\n",
    "These are the first parts of the query to be evaluated, specifying the rows upon\n",
    "which all the filtering, aggregation, and ordering functions are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll briefly cover `JOIN` and variants and then move to a conceptual overview\n",
    "of the order of execution of a SQL query followed by a detailed example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JOIN\n",
    "\n",
    "The `JOIN` clause enables querying based on relations in the data. It does so by\n",
    "making use of foreign keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every `JOIN` clause has two segments: first, specifying the table to join, and\n",
    "second, specifying the columns to match up (usually a primary key from one side\n",
    "matched up with a foreign key on another).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different kinds of `JOIN`s: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT OUTER JOIN`,\n",
    "`RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `NATURAL JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN` are some\n",
    "of the types.  We'll discuss the differences in just a moment. For now, we'll\n",
    "start with `INNER JOIN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple `INNER JOIN`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT customers.name, visits.created_at\n",
    "FROM visits\n",
    "INNER JOIN customers\n",
    "  ON customers.id = visits.customer_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each visit has a `customer_id` that corresponds to the `id` column in the customeres\n",
    "table. In SQL, you specify the correspondence in the `ON` segment of the `JOIN`\n",
    "clause. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For each match between `customers.id` and `visits.customer_id` that is found, a row is\n",
    "inserted into the result set.** That means that if a customer has visited the site\n",
    "multiple times, their information will be in the result set multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the result may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " name  |     created_at\n",
    "-------+---------------------\n",
    " john  | 2015-06-20 00:00:00\n",
    " john  | 2015-07-30 00:00:00\n",
    " sarah | 2015-06-20 00:00:00\n",
    " john  | 2015-04-09 00:00:00\n",
    " becky | 2015-03-09 00:00:00\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how some customers show up multiple times in the result set. This make\n",
    "sense given that some customers visted the site multiple times. You'll see later in\n",
    "this document a slightly more detailed look at how the RDBMS constructs a result\n",
    "set, including how it processes `JOIN`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL allows you to aggregate your data set based on common keys.  To see the number of visits\n",
    "from each customer_id we would query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*)\n",
    "FROM visits\n",
    "GROUP BY customer_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " customer_id | count\n",
    "-------------+-------\n",
    "           1 |     3\n",
    "           3 |     1\n",
    "           2 |     1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice** The GROUP BY clause tells SQL what common factor we'd like to use to aggregate the data.\n",
    "The COUNT aggregate function tells SQL how we'd like to aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we JOIN tables we are essentially creating a new table, so we can use aggregate functions when \n",
    "using JOINs.  To get the amount of profit from each product:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT products.name, products.id, SUM(purchases.quantity * products.price) AS profit\n",
    "FROM products\n",
    "JOIN purchases \n",
    "  ON products.id=purchases.product_id\n",
    "GROUP BY products.name, products.id\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "    name    | id | profit\n",
    "------------+----+--------\n",
    " iPod       |  2 |    400\n",
    " headphones |  3 |    200\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the results more readable, we can sort them.  Maybe we want the customers in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "ORDER BY NAME\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    " id | name  | age |     city      | state\n",
    "----+-------+-----+---------------+-------\n",
    "  2 | becky |  30 | NYC           | NY\n",
    "  1 | john  |  25 | San Francisco | CA\n",
    "  3 | sarah |  20 | Denver        | CO\n",
    "```\n",
    "And if we wanted them in reverse alphabetical order, we'd add the DESC keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "ORDER BY NAME DESC\n",
    "```\n",

    "  1 | john  |  25 | San Francisco | CA\n",
    "  2 | becky |  30 | NYC           | NY\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Order of Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL does not perform operations \"top to bottom\".  Rather it executes statements in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM, JOIN\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "GROUP BY \n",
    "HAVING\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "ORDER BY\n",
    "\n",
    "### `JOIN` types\n",
    "\n",
    "The various `JOIN`s specify how to deal with different circumstances regarding\n",
    "the primary and foreign key matchings. \n",
    "\n",
    "`INNER JOIN`s discard any entries that do not have a match between the keys\n",
    "specified in the `ON` clause. For example, in the above query, any customer who had\n",
    "not visited the site will NOT be in the result set because a match would not\n",
    "have been found between the customer's `id` and a visit's `customer_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `LEFT OUTER JOIN` keeps all the entries in the left table regardless of\n",
