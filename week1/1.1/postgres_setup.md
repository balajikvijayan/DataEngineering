# Setup Postgres

Here's the [postgres docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/), which can be useful for setting stuff up.

## Install Postgres

1. Install brew cask if you haven't already.

    * Install brew. Instructions [here](http://brew.sh/)
    * Install brew cask with: `brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask`
    
    If you already have them, update: `brew update && brew upgrade brew-cask`

1. Install your Postgres database. The easiest way to to install the pre-build application (with an adorable icon) using the following command:

    ```
    brew cask install postgres
    ```

    If you don't have homebrew, go [here](http://brew.sh/).

2. After the installation is complete, use Spotlight to search for `postgres` and open the Application. It will ask you if you want to move it to the Applications folder, say "Move it"


## Setting up psql on a Mac

1. Go to the home directory by running `cd` in the terminal

2. Open terminal configurations:

    * `subl `~/.bashrc`
    * if you are using zsh: `subl .zshrc` (if you are on your personal computer and don't know what this is, you are probably using bash, which is what's above)

3. Insert the following line at the end of the file and save the file.

   ```export PATH=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin:$PATH``` 

4. Open a new terminal and run `psql`
